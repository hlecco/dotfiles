## Homebrew

A very nice package manager. I've also tried Macports, but you are gonna need homebrew sometimes anyway so you'd better just stick to it for everything.

### Installed packages

I'm keeping a list of the installed formulae and casks.

To list formulae:
```
brew leaves --installed-on-request
```

To list casks:
```
brew list --cask
```
