# dotfiles

This repository is intended to keep up configs for my machine.
Currently I'm using a M1 Macbook Air, so settings apply for MacOS.

### Organization

Each directory corresponds to a different "component" of the system.
Things are not organized based on the specific software for each case, rather, what the softwares actually do.

Guides and instructions are preferred over plain copying and pasting config files.
